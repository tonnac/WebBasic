        <h1>HTML이란 무엇인가</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Markup Language (HTML)</a> is <strong>the standard <u>markup language</u></strong> for documents 
        designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies 
        such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

When a user requests a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the resulting web page on the user's device.
        A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[1][2] For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as Google Search, Bing, or DuckDuckGo, that stores searchable data about other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[3]
        As of March 2019, more than 4.3 billion people use a browser, which is about 55% of the world's population.[4] The three most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</p>
